## [COVID-19-Gender-Dataset-Analysis](https://github.com/shyampatel13/Shyam_Portfolio/blob/main/Covid-19%20Data/COVID-19_Dataset.ipynb)
In this project, we'll look at the covid-19 cases and confirmed deaths, from april to september of 2020, for the state of Connecticut. We will answer the following questions:
* Were there more male or female cases each month? Are males more likely to catch the virus versus females?
* How did confirmed cases and total deaths change over time?

* The analysis will provide general idea of where the Coronavirus is likely headed in terms of Total Cases/Deaths.
